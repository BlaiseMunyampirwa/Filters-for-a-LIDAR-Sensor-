# Filters-for-a-LIDAR-Sensor-
This software reduces noise in the data coming for a LIDAR sensor. 
It includes both a range filter and temporal median filter. 

In order to use the temporal median filter to reduce the noise in the data,
initialize an array of measurements as a vector and the 2-D accumulated data
up to the current scan.

In order to use the range filter, initialize an array of sensor measurements
as a 1-D vector.
